    Split a Debian version up into local and upstream parts.

    .. Warning::
        Although this should be 100% perfect for Debian package in the
        archive, it is very easy to craft a Debian binary that is native
        *and* has a `-` in the version string. However, seeing as how Debian
        policy ยง 5.6.12 (Version), prohibits this, we should be OK.
        In particular::
            The upstream_version may contain only alphanumerics and the
            characters . + - : ~ (full stop, plus, hyphen, colon, tilde)
            and should start with a digit. If there is no debian_revision
            then hyphens are not allowed; if there is no epoch then colons
            are not allowed.
